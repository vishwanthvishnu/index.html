<h2>1945</h2>
<p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/computer/bushf.htm">an article</a> in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/index.htm">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
<h2>1980</h2>
<p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. <br> Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/scaled/">Enquire user manual</a> as scanned images or as <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/manual/">HTML <br>page(alt)</a>.
